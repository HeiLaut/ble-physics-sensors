# BLE Sensors for physics lessons

## Goal

**Easy to use** and cheap sensor boxes for digital data acquisition that can be used in physics lessons by students or by the teacher as a demonstration.

Each Box can be built for under 20 â‚¬.

All boxes are equipped with an esp32, so that they can communicate via BLE or serial connection.
